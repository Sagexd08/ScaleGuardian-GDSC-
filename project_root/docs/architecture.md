# System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of our AI-powered content moderation system that combines Google's Gemini API for intelligent content analysis with blockchain technology for transparency and governance.

## Core Components

### 1. Browser Extension

The browser extension provides real-time content moderation through:

- **Background Script**: 
  - Manages extension state and configuration
  - Handles communication with backend services
  - Maintains user preferences and settings

- **Content Scripts**: 
  - Monitor and analyze page content in real-time
  - Apply moderation actions based on AI analysis
  - Integrate with the DOM for content filtering

- **AI Integration**:
  - Direct integration with Gemini API for content analysis
  - Local caching for improved performance
  - Fallback mechanisms for offline operation

- **Web3 Module**: 
  - Blockchain connectivity for verification
  - DAO interaction for governance
  - Wallet integration for transactions

### 2. Client Applications

#### Web Dashboard
React-based application providing:
- Content moderation management interface
- Analytics and reporting dashboard
- Governance participation portal
- Integration with Gemini API for bulk analysis

#### Mobile Application
React Native app offering:
- On-the-go moderation capabilities
- Push notifications for urgent content
- Mobile-optimized governance participation
- Simplified content reporting

### 3. Backend Infrastructure

#### API Server (Node.js/Express)
- RESTful API endpoints for client applications
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and request validation
- Blockchain transaction management
- Caching and performance optimization

#### AI Module
- Integration with Google's Gemini API
- Content classification and analysis
- Moderation policy enforcement
- Feedback processing for improvement
- Model performance monitoring

#### Blockchain Integration
- Smart contract interaction
- Transaction management
- Event logging and monitoring
- DAO governance support

### 4. Blockchain Layer

Smart contracts deployed on EVM-compatible chains:

#### Content Registry Contract
- Stores content moderation decisions
- Maintains appeal records
- Links to IPFS for metadata storage

#### Governance Contract
- DAO structure for decision-making
- Voting mechanisms
- Policy updates
- Staking and rewards

#### Token Contract
- Governance token management
- Staking mechanisms
- Reward distribution
- Voting power calculation

### 5. AI Layer (Gemini Integration)

- **Content Analysis Pipeline**:
  - Text analysis and classification
  - Context-aware moderation
  - Multi-language support
  - Real-time processing

- **Policy Enforcement**:
  - Rule-based decision making
  - Confidence scoring
  - Appeal handling
  - Automated actions
