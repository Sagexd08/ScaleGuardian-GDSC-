# System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the AI-powered content moderation system with blockchain transparency.

## Components

### 1. Browser Extension

The browser extension operates in real-time to detect potentially problematic content on web pages. It consists of:

- **Background Script**: Manages extension state and communicates with the backend
- **Content Scripts**: Analyze page content and apply moderation actions
- **Popup UI**: User interface for configuration and feedback
- **AI Module**: Lightweight client-side detection for common patterns
- **Web3 Module**: Connects to blockchain for verification of moderation logs

### 2. Client Applications

#### Web Client
React-based dashboard for moderation teams and content reporters:
- Content reporting interface
- Moderation dashboard
- Governance participation

#### Mobile Client
React Native application with similar functionality to the web client but optimized for mobile devices.

### 3. Backend Server

Express.js server that handles:
- Content ingestion and analysis
- AI model inference for complex detection
- User authentication and authorization
- Blockchain transaction submission
- API for clients and extension

### 4. Blockchain Layer

Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum (or compatible chains) that:
- Store hashed content references
- Log moderation actions
- Enable governance through a DAO structure
- Provide transparency and immutability for moderation decisions

### 5. Machine Learning Module

Python-based ML system that:
- Trains and deploys content classification models
- Provides inference endpoints for the backend
- Handles model versioning and updates
- Processes feedback for continuous improvement

## Data Flow

1. **Content Detection**:
   - Content is analyzed by the browser extension
   - Local ML models provide initial classification
   - Complex content is sent to the backend for detailed analysis

2. **Moderation Process**:
   - Backend processes content and makes moderation decisions
   - Actions are applied through the extension or clients
   - All decisions are logged to the blockchain

3. **Governance**:
   - Community members can challenge moderation decisions
   - DAO voting for contested decisions
   - Updates to moderation policies through governance

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - User feedback collected for false positives/negatives
   - ML models retrained with new data
   - Moderation policies adjusted based on governance decisions

## Security Considerations

- All communications between components use TLS
- Sensitive user data is never stored on-chain
- Content hashes rather than raw content are used for blockchain records
- Authentication and authorization for all backend operations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale horizontally:
- Stateless backend services can be replicated
- ML inference can be distributed
- Blockchain read operations use event indexing for performance
